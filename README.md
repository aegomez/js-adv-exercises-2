JavaScript Advanced Exercises 2

[Exercises 1-7 (Promises, Algorithms)](https://github.com/aegomez/js-adv-exercises)

## Core JavaScript

8. Implement the flatten function that will produce the expected output. Create solutions with an imperative and a functional style approach.

9. Implement an array flattening function with recursive and iterative versions. Do not use the built-in function.

10. Given a representation of a binary tree, implement a function that can traverse all nodes in prefix, infix, and postfix order.

11. Write an enhanced DOM querySelectAll method that can support the following selector:

    - Select nodes whose children match a pattern. Must select the direct parent of the child selector.

    - `‘<parent-selector> < <child-selector>’`

12. Traverse a binary tree and determine if the tree is a symmetric.

13. Given the root of a tree, write a function that takes two numbers, n1 and n2. Search for these two numbers within the tree and indicate if they are found at the same depth.

14. Find the greatest area formed by rectangles of 1's in a binary matrix.

15. Given an array of natural numbers of length N, find the index of that array that balances the left and right sum. If no such position exists, return -1.

16. Find the node at the beginning of a loop in a singly linked list.

17. Given a singly linked list as input, determine if the content is a palindrome.

18. Implement shorthand deep object property assignment.

19. Using the provided test functions as a base, make it so that the assert function behaves as the example. The code inside the `index.html` file cannot be altered.

    - All non-delayed tests should appear immediately.
    - Test delayed B should appear after .5 seconds have elapsed.
    - Test delayed A should appear after 1 second has elapsed.

20. Create a Sierpiński triangle using HTML DIV elements. Allow for the number of divisions to be selected through a UI.

## NodeJS

22. Using ASCII characters, create an animated indeterminate loading bar.
